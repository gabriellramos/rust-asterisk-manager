## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-24

This release introduces a comprehensive resilient connection module for production-ready, high-availability applications. The new resilient module provides automatic reconnection, heartbeat monitoring, and fault-tolerant event streaming while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing APIs.

### Added
- **Resilient Connection Module**: Complete solution for production AMI connections
  - `ResilientOptions` struct with extensive configuration options
  - `connect_resilient()` function for creating resilient managers
  - `infinite_events_stream()` for fault-tolerant event streaming
- **Configurable Parameters**:
  - `max_retries`: Configurable maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
  - `heartbeat_interval`: Configurable heartbeat interval in seconds (default: 30)
  - `watchdog_interval`: Configurable watchdog check interval (default: 1 second)
  - `buffer_size`: Configurable event broadcaster buffer size (default: 2048)
- **Production-Ready Features**:
  - Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
  - Comprehensive logging with timestamps and attempt tracking
  - Stream instance identification for debugging multi-instance scenarios
  - Global cumulative attempt counter that persists across stream recreations
  - Optional metrics collection with `ResilientMetrics` struct
- **Enhanced Heartbeat System**:
  - `start_heartbeat_with_interval()` method for custom heartbeat intervals
  - Backward-compatible `start_heartbeat()` method (uses 30-second default)
  - Watchdog monitoring for automatic reconnection on heartbeat failures
- **Advanced Logging**:
  - Detailed reconnection attempt tracking with timing information
  - Production-appropriate log levels (DEBUG for periodic events, INFO/WARN for significant events)
  - Sleep duration verification to identify timing discrepancies
  - Stream lifecycle tracking with unique instance identifiers

### Added

-   **Resilient Connection Module**: New `src/resilient.rs` module with production-ready features for mission-critical applications:
    -   **Automatic Reconnection**: Seamless reconnection when connections are lost with configurable retry logic
    -   **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Configurable ping intervals to detect connection issues early and maintain connection health
    -   **Infinite Event Streams**: Never-ending event streams that handle reconnection transparently using `infinite_events_stream()`
    -   **Watchdog Functionality**: Monitors authentication status and triggers reconnection when needed
    -   **Configurable Buffer Sizes**: Optimized memory usage for high-throughput applications via `Manager::new_with_buffer(size)`

-   **New API Functions**:
    -   `connect_resilient()` function for creating Manager instances with resilient features enabled
    -   `infinite_events_stream()` for fault-tolerant, never-ending event streaming
    -   `ResilientOptions` configuration struct for fine-tuning resilient behavior (heartbeat intervals, buffer sizes, etc.)

### Changed

-   **ResilientOptions additions**: The `ResilientOptions` struct now exposes additional configuration knobs:
    - `heartbeat_interval` (u64, seconds) — controls how often a heartbeat `Ping` is sent when `enable_heartbeat` is true (default: 30).
    - `max_retries` (u32) — number of immediate reconnection attempts before the reconnect logic resets the counter and waits using exponential backoff (default: 3).
    - `metrics` (Option<ResilientMetrics>) — optional metrics collection for monitoring reconnection behavior (default: None).

-   **Improved reconnection logging**: Enhanced visibility into reconnection attempts with detailed logs including:
    - Cumulative attempt counters and jitter-adjusted delays
    - Sleep duration tracking to identify timing issues
    - Production-friendly log levels (periodic attempts use DEBUG, failures/successes use INFO/WARN)
    - Timestamps for predicted retry times

-   **Jitter in backoff delays**: Added jitter to exponential backoff to prevent thundering herd effects when multiple instances reconnect simultaneously.

Upgrade note: If your code constructs `ResilientOptions` manually, add the `max_retries` and `metrics` fields or switch to `ResilientOptions::default()` and adjust fields as needed. The default values preserve the previous behavior (30s heartbeat, 3 retries, no metrics).-   **Production-Ready Examples**:
    -   **Resilient Actix Web Example** (`examples/actix_web_resilient_example.rs`): Demonstrates resilient connections in a real-world web application scenario with automatic reconnection
    -   **Examples Documentation** (`examples/README.md`): Comprehensive comparison between traditional and resilient approaches

-   **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated README.md with detailed resilient features documentation, usage examples, and feature comparisons

### Fixed

-   Fixed compilation error in `examples/actix_web_example.rs` by removing incorrect `crate::` prefix

### Enhanced

-   **Testing**: Added 20 comprehensive unit tests covering all resilient functionality
-   **Backward Compatibility**: All existing APIs remain unchanged and fully functional

## [2.0.0] - 2025-06-20

This release introduces a complete architectural overhaul for robust concurrency and adds intelligent features for handling complex AMI actions. It includes breaking changes to the connection API and response structures.

### Added

-   **Intelligent List Collection**: The `send_action` method now automatically detects actions that return lists of events (e.g., `PJSIPShowEndpoints`). It transparently collects all related events and bundles them into a single, aggregated `AmiResponse` in a new `CollectedEvents` field.
-   **Optional API Documentation**: Added support for `utoipa` via a `docs` feature flag. When enabled, all public response and event types implement `ToSchema`, allowing consuming applications to easily generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.

### Changed

-   **BREAKING: Connection API**: The `Manager::new()` constructor no longer accepts `ManagerOptions`. The connection is now established via a new method `manager.connect_and_login(options)`, which requires a mutable `Manager` handle. This makes the connection lifecycle more explicit and robust.
-   **BREAKING: `AmiResponse` Structure**: The `fields` field in `AmiResponse` was changed from `HashMap<String, String>` to `HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>` to support embedding the complex list of collected events from list-based actions.

### Fixed

-   **Concurrency Deadlock**: Re-architected the internal I/O handling to use dedicated, non-blocking tasks (Reader, Writer, Dispatcher). This resolves fundamental deadlock and timeout issues that occurred in high-concurrency environments (like web servers with multiple workers), ensuring actions are processed quickly and reliably.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-12

This release marks a complete architectural overhaul of the library, moving from a callback-based design to a modern, stream-based, and strongly-typed API. It introduces significant breaking changes from the `0.1.x` series.

### Changed

-   **BREAKING: Architectural Redesign**: The library was rebuilt around an actor-like model. The `Manager` is now a lightweight, cloneable handle to an internal, thread-safe client that runs its own I/O task in the background.
-   **BREAKING: Event Handling**: The callback-based system (`.on_event()`, `.on_all_events()`, etc.) has been entirely replaced by a stream-based API. Event consumption is now done via `manager.all_events_stream()`, which returns a `tokio_stream::Stream`.
-   **BREAKING: Strongly-Typed Messages**: Replaced generic `serde_json::Value` for all messages with strongly-typed `AmiAction`, `AmiEvent`, and `AmiResponse` enums and structs. This improves type safety, reduces runtime errors, and provides better editor autocompletion.
-   **BREAKING: API Simplification**: The `ManagerBuilder` has been removed. The library now has a single entry point: `Manager::new(options)`.
-   **BREAKING: Action Submission**: The `send_action` method is now fully async and returns a `Future<Result<AmiResponse, AmiError>>`. It waits for the corresponding response from Asterisk instead of being a "fire-and-forget" method.
-   **BREAKING: Internal I/O Loop**: The user no longer needs to call `read_data_with_retries()`. The I/O loop is now an internal implementation detail and runs automatically in a background task after a successful `connect_and_login()`.
-   **BREAKING: Error Handling**: Replaced `Result<..., String>` with a comprehensive `AmiError` enum for structured error handling.

### Added

-   **Request/Response Correlation**: Built-in, automatic `ActionID` generation and correlation for all actions sent.
-   **Concurrent Event Consumption**: The new event stream system uses `tokio::sync::broadcast`, allowing multiple parts of an application to listen to events concurrently from a single AMI connection.
-   **New Example Applications**:
    -   A new "Getting Started" example demonstrating the stream-based API.
    -   A robust `actix_web_example.rs` showcasing a resilient web service with a self-healing event collection task and reconnection logic.

### Removed

-   Removed `ManagerBuilder`.
-   Removed all callback registration methods: `on_event`, `on_all_events`, `on_all_raw_events`, `on_all_response_events`.
-   Removed public I/O methods: `read_data`, `read_data_with_retries`.
-   Removed `Participant` management from the core library, allowing users to implement their own state management based on the event stream.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2025-01-22

Initial version of the library with a callback-based API.

### Added

-   `ManagerBuilder` for constructing a `Manager` instance with event callbacks.
-   Callback registration for specific, all, raw, and response events.
-   Internal reconnection logic with `connect_with_retries` and `read_data_with_retries`.
-   Basic participant management.
-   Used `serde_json::Value` for generic handling of actions and events.
